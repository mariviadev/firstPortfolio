# Mariam Khan | First Portfolio Site

## Overview
This portfolio was created as part of the CCT260H5 web development course at the University of Toronto. The project involved designing and developing a custom portfolio website to showcase my professional experience using HTML and CSS. The development process was divided into three main phases: Planning, Prototyping, and Programming.

## Planning
I started by outlining project requirements and components. I quickly moved from wireframing to high-fidelity mockups using Figma, focusing on creating a clear site structure and layout. 

## Prototyping
For design inspiration, I researched similar examples and incorporated effective elements into my prototypes. Tools used included Figma (for prototyping and design) and various plugins like Iconify and Fast Isometric for icons and images. Microsoft Designer’s Image Creator was used for generating profile and spotlight images.

## Programming
Converting the Figma prototypes to code was streamlined by Figma’s Dev Mode, which provided detailed element properties. I used HTML and CSS, focusing on concepts from the course, with additional techniques learned from Scrimba and W3Schools. The final code was refined to enhance efficiency and readability, consolidating multiple stylesheets into one and adjusting class names to prevent conflicts.

## Design Improvements
The final site includes several design improvements over the initial prototype, such as enhanced accessibility features and visual appeal adjustments. These include refined button styles, improved text contrast, and updated images.

## Accessibility
The site adheres to WCAG 2.0 accessibility standards. I used the WAVE tool to ensure no contrast errors, appropriate alt text, and correct form associations. Minor alerts related to video captions and headings were not relevant to the site’s context.
